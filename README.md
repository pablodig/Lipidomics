## Changes in the lipid composition of thyroid cells under the influence of the TSH-CREB3L1 axis

### 1 Changes in lipid composition under TSH stimulation
TSH induce changes in genes related to thyroid specific function, as well as genes involved in the adaptation of the cell in order to work as a thyroid cell. For example, TSH acts on lipid biosynthetic pathways needed for thyrocites proliferation. TSH as well as the cAMP agonist, forskolin, transcriptionally induce the enzime 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR, Aloj et al., 1990), which represent the limiting step in cholesterol synthesis, and the malic enzyme, involved in the synthesis of fatty acids. Similar to the effect mediated by CREB3L1 in response to TSH, it was reported that TSH induces the activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs), which are the main transcriptional modulators the lipid synthesis. In addition, the SREPB-1c and SREBP-2 factors also activate the transcription of genes involved in the synthesis of thyroid hormones, such as NIS, TPO and TG (Rauer et al., 2014; Ringseis et al., 2013).  

Based on our results, which indicate that CREB3L1 induces an increase in Golgi volume, and results obtained by other laboratories, we hypothesize that CREB3L1 would participate in the cross-regulatory talk between the lipid and protein biosynthesis pathways necessary to increase the secretory capacity of the cell. To analyze cross-regulatory mechanisms between the lipid and protein biosynthetic pathways, we evaluated the lipid composition of the rat thyroid follicular cell line PCCL3, stimulated with TSH at different times by lipidomics assays, a technique based on high performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. This was done in collaboration with the laboratory of Giovani D'Angelo (Laboratory of Lipid Biology, EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland). Assays were performed on PCCL3 cells that were incubated under growth conditions for 24 h, subsequently deprived of TSH (starvation conditions) for 72 h, and then stimulated with TSH for 24 h and 48 h. Before performing the lipidomics assays, TSH response was confirmed by Western blot using anit-CREB3L1, GM130 and NIS antibodies **(Figure. 1)**.

Lipidomics assays revealed a great difference in the composition of the lipids studied **(Figure 2)** in the different conditions. In the absence of TSH, some lipids decrease, such as Diacylglycerols (DAG), Triacylglycerols (TAG), Sphingomyelin (SM), Glucosylceramide (GlcCer) while others increase, such as Phosphatidylcholine (PC), Phosphatidylserine (PS) and Cardiolipins (CL) compared to cells grown under growth conditions (control).

On the other hand, upon TSH stimulation (24 h and 48 h, **Figure 2**), especially after 48 h, an increase in DAG, TAG and lysobisphosphatidic acid (LBPA), a group of lipids associated with late endosomes, is detected. Furthermore, the group of sphingolipids (SLs) that include ceramides (CER), glucosylceramides (GlcCer) and sphingomyelins (SM) also increases. SLs contribute to Golgi function, participating in signaling, protein transport, and membrane deformation (Halter et al., 2007). SLs such as SM and GlcCer decrease their levels considerably after TSH deprivation, and increase when stimulated with TSH **(Figure 2)**. It stands out that the lipids that decrease are those that increased after TSH deprivation, such as PC, PS and CL.

Quantitative comparison between TSH (0h) vs TSH (48h) conditions after considering a 4-fold increase or decrease as a cut-off point **(Figure 3 A)** confirmed what was qualitatively shown in **Figure 2**.

Enrichment analysis using the software LION: _"Lipid Ontology Enrichment Analysis”_ [http://www.lipidontology.com, (Molenaar et al., 2019)] revealed the chemical and functional identity of several lipid metabolic pathways involved in the response to TSH **(Figure 3 B and C)**. Within the classifications associated to chemical structure are neutral head lipids, glycerolipids, triacylglycerols and diacylglycerols represented by the large amount of TAG and DAG increased in this condition. This result agrees with previous reports where it was shown that the increase in TAG is mediated by TSH in adipocytes (Ma et al., 2015). Among the classifications associated with biological functions are "lipid storage" and "lipid droplets", mainly caused by the increase in TAG, which is the main component of these structures that function as energy reservoirs within the cell. In addition, the metabolic pathways related to hexosylceramide, the precursor of several sphingolipids, are also enriched against stimulation with TSH **(Figure 3 B)**, although to a lesser extent.

On the other hand, among the lipid metabolic pathways that decrease in response to TSH, those related to phospholipids such as PC and PS are represented **(Figure 3 C)**. The chemical classifications of the lipids involved are: headgroup with positive charge, and glycerophosphocholines and diacylglycerophosphocholines, precursors of PC and PS, among others. The main classification that involves biological characteristics is ER (endoplasmic reticulum) due to the large number of phospholipids involved in the structure of this organelle (van Meer et al., 2008). Finally, several pathways related to physicochemical properties that refer to the role of phospholipids in membrane composition and function (such as neutral intrinsic curvature, low transition temperature, high lateral diffusion) **(Figure 3 C)** were also identified.

To corroborate the effect of TSH on sphingolipid synthesis within the cell, we performed immunofluorescence analyzes in TSH-stimulated PCCL3 cells to identify two sphingolipids representative of different metabolic pathways: GM1, a ganglio-series sphingolipid whose function is related to cell differentiation (Russo et al., 2018), and SM, mainly involved in intracellular trafficking processes (Hannun & Obeid, 2018). Cholera toxin subunit B (isolated from Vibrio cholerae) and echinotoxin-II (isolated from the sea anemone Actinia equina) were used for the specific labeling of GM1 and SM, respectively (Russo et al. al., 2018). It was observed that, compared to cells cultured in growth medium, TSH deprivation for 72 h, TSH (0 h), increases the fluorescence signal of GM1 (Cholera Tx, **Figure 4**), while, in the case of SM, labeled with echinotoxin-II (Equina Tx), the opposite happens. In contrast, after stimulation with TSH, a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of Cholera Tx, and an increase in Equina Tx signal are observed **(Figure 4)**. The increase in SM levels could be a consequence of the increase in Golgi volume induced by TSH stimulation. These results were corroborated using flow cytometry in cells deprived from TSH for 72 h and then stimulated for 24 h. As can be seen in **Figure 5**, TSH deprivation for 72 h causes an increase in GM1 levels **(-TSH, Cholera Tx, Figure 5)**, as well as a decrease in SM **(-TSH, Equina Tx, Figure 5)** . In agreement with the results of the confocal images, the stimulation with TSH for 24 h produces a slight decrease in the levels of GM1 **(+TSH, Cholera Tx, Figure 5)**, while no changes were observed in the levels of SM **(+TSH , Equine Tx, Figure 5)**.

To evaluate whether the production of SM, and sphingolipids as a whole, is necessary for the adaptation of the thyroid cell to TSH stimulation, the effect of the inhibition of sphingolipid synthesis in this process was analyzed. For this, two specific inhibitors that act at different stages of the metabolic pathway of sphingolipid synthesis were used **(Figure 6)**: Myriocin, a serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) inhibitor, virtually blocks the synthesis of all sphingolipids by inhibiting the production of CER (Hojjati et al., 2005); and PDMP, an inhibitor of ceramide glucosyltransferase (GCS), blocks the synthesis of GlcCer, and therefore of all the glycosylated sphingolipids (glycosphingolipids) derived from it. PDMP also causes accumulation of SM and Galactosylceramide.
